# 🐞 Insect Species Identifier

Welcome to the **Insect Species Identifier** – an AI-powered web app that identifies insect species from images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model and a lightweight MobileNetV2 architecture.

Developed by **Pragya Srivastava**, this project blends machine learning with an interactive Streamlit interface to provide fast and accurate insect recognition.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- ✅ Pre-trained CNN model based on **MobileNetV2**
- ✅ Input image is resized and normalized
- ✅ Model predicts the insect class from 11 categories
- ✅ Clean, user-friendly interface built with **Streamlit**

---

## 🐛 Supported Insect Classes

- Ant  
- Bee  
- Beetle  
- Butterfly  
- Dragonfly  
- Fly  
- Grasshopper  
- Ladybug  
- Mosquito  
- Spider  
- Wasp
